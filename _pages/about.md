## Education

My name is Ethan Milton, I'm a Mechanical Engineering senior at Vanderbilt University, with a double minor in Computer Science and Digital Fabrication. I'm hoping to pursue rehabilitation engineering (exoskeletons, prosthetics) in the future. After Vanderbilt, I'm heading to graduate school to get a Masters. I'm an avid programmer, musician, artist, engineer, and nerd.

## More About Me
I hail from Miami, Florida, and I'm an Eagle Scout which together give me a love for the outdoors and the ocean as well. Some of my hobbies include hiking, sailing, songwriting, generative art and simulations, software development, creative writing, and designing in CAD.
