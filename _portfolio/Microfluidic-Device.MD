## Introduction
Microfluidic devices are small-scale systems designed to control and process tiny fluid volumes, usually in the microliter or nanoliter range, through microscale channels. They are commonly used in biomedical research, diagnostics, and chemical analysis but can also be used in environmental monitoring, drug development, and food safety testing.

Pinched flow fractionation (PFF) is a passive microfluidic technique used for continuously sorting particles by size within a channel. It relies on laminar flow properties, where a particle-free fluid focuses the particle-containing fluid as they pass through a narrow "pinched segment." In this region, the particles are pushed against one of the channelâ€™s sidewalls, and align based on their size, with smaller particles positioned closer to the wall and larger particles closer to the channel center. As the flow exits the pinched segment into a broader section, particles separate along their streamlines. Their final position can be calculated as a function of the pinched and broad section widths as well as the particle diameters. 

This method enables precise particle sorting without requiring external forces, making it useful for applications involving droplet or cell separation. One potential use case could be separating cancer cells from blood cells in a blood sample.
