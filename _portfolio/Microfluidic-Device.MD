## Introduction

Pinched flow fractionation (PFF) is a passive microfluidic technique used for continuously sorting particles by size within a microchannel. It relies on laminar flow properties, where a particle-free fluid focuses the particle-containing fluid as they pass through a narrow "pinched segment." In this region, particles align along one of the channel’s sidewalls based on their size, with smaller particles positioned closer to the wall and larger particles closer to the channel center. As the flow exits the pinched segment into a broader section, particles separate perpendicular to the main flow direction due to differences in their streamline positions. This method enables precise particle sorting without requiring external forces, making it useful for applications involving droplet or cell separation.
