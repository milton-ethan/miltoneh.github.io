## Introduction
Top down modeling...
Blah [PolyJet](https://www.stratasys.com/en/industries-and-applications/3d-printing-applications/rapid-prototyping/) blah blah

I wanted to focus on a few key elements in my design:
- Bullet Point


## CAD Model

## Design & Iteration
The main idea behind my design ...


To ensure my detent mechanism would function as anticipated, and that I had the right tolerance to press-fit my phone into the holder, I printed some test pieces out of PLA. This also let me test how effective my idea of using a heat set insert to screw in a retaining disk to hold the detent mechanism was. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/miltoneh.github.io/assets/img/phoneHolderTest1.jpg" width="45%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;" />
  <img src="/miltoneh.github.io/assets/img/phoneHolderTest2.jpg" width="45%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;" />
</div>

The detent and the retaining disk worked like a charm, but my press fit was a little loose, leading me to tighten the tolerance ever so slightly. Since PLA will tend to warp sligthly (much more than with SLS printing), I used calipers to make sure I was getting real measurements off my test print instead of relying off the dimensions in CAD.

The result of these test prints and caution was a rigid stable phone mount with full functionality on the first print! 

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/miltoneh.github.io/assets/img/phoneHolderFinal1.jpg" width="45%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;" />
  <img src="/miltoneh.github.io/assets/img/phoneHolderFinal2.jpg" width="45%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;" />
  <img src="/miltoneh.github.io/assets/img/phoneHolderFinal3.jpg" width="45%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;" />
</div>

Since SLS printing is more costly and labor intensive than standard FFF printing, it's important to be sure you have a good idea of how your part is going to turn out before pressing print. This, to me, illustrates why having a diverse range of rapid prototyping technologies is so beneficial.

Blah Blah...
