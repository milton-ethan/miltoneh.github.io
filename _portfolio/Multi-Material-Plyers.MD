## Introduction
Print-in-place (PIP) design allows for fully functional assemblies to be fabricated in a single print without requiring post-assembly. This technique has been used in a variety of applications, from articulated models to complex mechanical components like hinges and gears. Multi-material 3D printing enhances PIP designs by integrating rigid and flexible materials, expanding the range of potential use cases.

## Design & Iteration
The primary challenge in designing print-in-place pliers was ensuring the spring mechanism functioned correctly without requiring assembly. The iterative process involved:
- Creating integrated flexures for the spring mechanism
- Adjusting material combinations to optimize stiffness and flexibility
- Ensuring the moving parts did not fuse during printing
- Testing different hinge designs to reduce wear over time

The final model features a reinforced handle, optimized jaw shape for gripping, and a resilient spring structure that retains elasticity after multiple uses.

## Specifications
- **Jaw Length:** 50mm
- **Jaw Capacity:** 15mm
- **Material Combination:** PLA (rigid) + TPU (flexible) for enhanced grip

## Print Settings
- **Layer Height:** 0.2mm
- **Infill:** 30%
- **Supports:** None (designed for print-in-place functionality)
- **Bed Adhesion:** Brim for stability
